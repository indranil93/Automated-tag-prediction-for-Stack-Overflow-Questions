# Automated-tag-prediction-for-Stack-Overflow-Questions
Given a random question, our system returns a set of tags that are most similar to the question asked.
Our classification system achieves an optimal Accuracy score of 60.00% on a subsampled portion of the original data restricted to 100 tags and a minimum of 50 instances of each tag across the data.
The Code is divied into 3 parts:
Data cleaning and Preprocessing:
    Process_title.java
Feature Extraction:
    features.cpp
Classification and prediction:
    classifier.py
